    <div>
        <h2>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page</h2>
        <h3>Home Page</h3>
        <p>
            My website designed with tools such as Html and CSS. I was focusing on meeting the requirements so I had to produce written content and development content. I would like to explain how each page is designed. I decided to divide my website into seven pages and named them: Home, About Me, Unit1. Outcome 1, Unit1. Outcome 2, Unit1. Outcome 3, Unit2. Outcome 1 and Contact. My first home page has a horizontal navigation bar made with Html and styled with CSS. It allows you to click on each link at this particular navigation bar and get to other pages. I applied to hover effect on each link, so when the user moves his mouse and stays on each navigation link, then it changes colour from blue to red, also text colour changes inside each link from white to black. The second thing I did at the home page, was adding the main ("Network") image, sized it to align to the navigation bar, stretched to 100%. In the middle of this image, I added animated text saying "Welcome to my website portfolio", capitalized all the letters. On the bottom of this page, I included my full name, just to use id once on my entire website.
        </p>

        <h3>About Me Page</h3>
        <p>
            My second page and the rest of the pages have titles and paragraphs, almost every paragraph has a subtitle because to answer every question, sometimes I had to use a few paragraphs. In the "About Me" page I also added a navigation bar, the same design as in the previous home page. I used flex to align my portfolio image with a text. I also used box-sizing and padding to achieve the desired space between each page edge. I applied box-sizing for my portfolio image and text. Below on the same page, I continued with paragraphs. In each paragraph, I included many links. For example portfolio Code Nation GitHub links or QA Consulting links. I also added more links to my employment. Some links a linked to my pdf files, for example, some certificates that I accomplished. Other links direct the user to original websites of locations like my University. My Bachelors of Interior Design portfolio available on a few of these website links, it is made with Wix.com and should open in the Internet Explorer browser.
        </p>

        <h3>Unit1 Outcome 1, 2, 3, Unit2. Outcome 1 and Contact Page</h3>
        <p>
            My third, fourth, fifth and sixth pages pretty the same with a lot of text and links with references. I added references in the middle of the text and at the end of each question answer. On my third page, I included six images with statistics, created div class for images, changed the size of it in the main CSS file. I applied background colour of white for all pages because I wanted this website to look simple, my aim was not to distract the user with a lot of colours or focus on reading the pages, pay attention to details of links that he could access. My last page is a contact page, has a footer and access to my email address. I used mailto to link my private email to this website.
        </p>

    <!----------------------------------- Div for 1.5 question ------------------------------------>
    <div>
        <h2>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h2>
        <h3>Website Copyrights</h3>
        <p>
            Every original piece of work must be protected by copyrights. What is the copyright of a website? "Copyright protects original works of authorship, including the text, graphics, photographs, sound recordings and audio, visual elements of websites and their underlying computer programs." <a href="https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/how-to-copyright-a-website" target="_blank">[1]</a>. It is essential to have copyrights for authentic work. If somebody decides to use the content of your website without your consent, it is classified as data breaching. Nobody can "copyright a domain name or the title of a website and copyright ideas, procedures, systems or methods of operation" <a href="https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/how-to-copyright-a-website" target="_blank">[1]</a>. If we have website copyrights for our website, we should include our website application terms and conditions <a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/blog/does-my-website-really-need-a-terms-and-conditions-page" target="_blank">[2]</a>. The advantage of having those copyrights, "would recover statutory damages and attorneys fees" <a href="https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/how-to-copyright-a-website" target="_blank">[1]</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Other Constraints Affecting Websites</h3>
        <p>
            One of the website constraints could be "website viewports" <a href="https://www.dummies.com/web-design-development/site-development/what-are-the-constraints-of-web-page-design/" target="_blank">[3]</a>, meaning that page has to be responsive: opened on different web browsers, on different devices, for example, website and mobile application. Users should be able to zoom in and out some parts of your website. It increases readability, helps to navigate especially maps should be designed in a way that users would have a smooth experience. Pages should have relevant content. For example, if a child is visiting your website and you are selling alcohol there, then should be some restrictions that would block the viewer from visiting this site, maybe some alerts asking about your age. Another restriction could be "security measures up to date" <a href="https://www.freelock.com/newsletter/10-problems-web-development-projects-and-how-weve-solved-them" target="_blank">[4]</a>. For example, if anyone purchasing items online, then their data should be secured and safe, the details should be protected from public access.

    <!----------------------------------- Div for 1.6 question ------------------------------------>
    <div>
        <h2>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them</h2>
        <h3>My Healthcare Experience</h3>
        <p>
            I worked with a variety of people from the elderly to adults, teenagers or children with complex physical and sensory needs or people at risk of domestic violence, substance misuse, and addiction. I supported my clients with Autism who had common seizures due to Epilepsy, quiet often they suffered from Challenging Behaviors. I worked for five years in private and residential care homes, hospitals, learning disability day centers or social homes. Many patients suffered from mental disorders or depression, elderly - from Dementia or Alzheimer's disease. I had people, who had cancer, were receiving medical treatment and required psychological support, or people, who had a stroke and were learning how to read or write, most of them had Dyslexia. My duty was to provide opportunities for getting people skilled up for living independently as much as they can. I assisted with a range of psycho-social and educational programs.
        </p>

        <h3>Difficulties With Website Access, Reading, Vision, Hearing Issues</h3>
        <p>
            Everybody is different and everybody may have different needs regarding website access. We should take into account that some people may are not able to read because the text font is too small. In this scenario, we could include a zooming pan tool or let users change the text size by implementing a scrolling bar with a selection of different fonts. Some people may suffer from Dyslexia when there is a "confusion between letters or have poor or inconsistent spelling" <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/dyslexia/" target="_blank">[2]</a>. If the website user has Dyslexia and wants to write something on a website, we could include grammar spelling feature, or if it is easier to include audio for each task or voice recognition. Now we touching a topic about machine learning. I found a website, where says: "Machine learning is a fast-growing trend in the health care industry, wearable devices and sensors can use data to assess a patient's health in real-time. The technology can also help medical experts analyze data to identify trends or red flags that may lead to improved diagnoses and treatment" <a href="https://www.sas.com/en_gb/insights/analytics/machine-learning.html" target="_blank">[3]</a>. It was mentioned that sensor wearables are used for medical purposes like sending a signal when you are required certain medication. But it also could be an idea to be connected to your computer or phone via the wireless system and it would cause to have access to the desired website. For example application on the wearable device may monitor your health but at the same time could spell text for you as well. May would be a problem in general with certain colours, we could add adjusting feature of colours on our website, also pictures or videos can distract sometimes, so we should think of website content carefully and think who is our audience, what this website is created for.

        <h3>Difficulties With Website Access, Reading, Writing, Speaking Issues, About Stephen Hawking</h3>
        <p>
            What about people who can not even speak. I think everybody knows famous Stephen Hawking who could not speak but with access to "Intel" <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/01/intel-gave-stephen-hawking-voice/" target="_blank">[4]</a> technologies could become a researcher. He was an "English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and author who was director of research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology at the University of Cambridge and He was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge" <a href="https://www.biography.com/scientist/stephen-hawking" target="_blank">[5]</a>. "Intel has been providing Hawking with customized PCs and technical support because Hawking lost his ability to speak in 1985, when, on a trip to CERN in Geneva, he caught pneumonia. For a while, Hawking communicated using a spelling card, patiently indicating letters and forming words with a lift of his eyebrows". It seems complicated but scientists found the way to solve Hawking's problem, he could speak but could use technologies to write his dissertations, even graduate "at University of Cambridge and Oxford"<a href="https://www.biography.com/scientist/stephen-hawking" target="_blank">[5]</a>. I think to improve someone's access to the website if they can not speak, read or write, we can by using voice recognition features like "Google, Amazon, iOS Siri" <a href="https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/voice-recognition-software/" target="_blank">[6]</a>. Probably could have many more ideas of improving access to websites but here just a few examples that everything is possible.

    <!----------------------------------- Div for 1.7 question ------------------------------------>
    <div>
        <h2>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate ﬁletypes for websites</h2>
        <h3>HTML File</h3>
        <p>
            We are already using many different files daily but which are the appropriate ﬁletypes for websites? I will describe each the most common filetype and where it is used. When I started my website, the first thing I have done, created a .html file in my Visual Studio. This code is called the "HyperText Markup Language file" <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/html/index.htm" target="_blank">[1]</a>. It is a language that is used today. The great thing is that once we are running the Html file, we can open our website on Internet Explorer or Google Chrome. Html is designed for creating a website structure, we can write all the text, add links of images or videos or audio or any other filetype. Html uses tags that help to render details in a browser, for example, if we decided to add title, we use h1 tag, each number has a different size for a title, 1 is the biggest and 6 is the smallest. If we want to create some text inside our website, we can use p tag for a paragraph. Another use of Html is to navigate from one page to another, I used a reference tag to reference other Html pages or existing website links to my portfolio for example. Html is responsive because it can work on different platforms like mobile devices, tablets, websites <a href="https://www.yourhtmlsource.com/starthere/fileformats.html" target="_blank">[2]</a>, there is new version Html5 which has more features for "animation, games" <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/html/index.htm" target="_blank">[1]</a>. 
        </p>

        <h3>CSS File</h3>
        <p>
            CSS means "Cascading StyleSheet and describes the style of an HTML document " <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp" target="_blank">[3]</a>. I used CSS for designing text, adding different font or change font size, adding background color on my website. It is a designing tool and let you write classes, where you can manipulate image size, location. On a website page, we specify borders, margins, padding. It is some space around an object like image, text, buttons, etc.
        </p>

        <h3>JavaScript File</h3>
        <p>
            JavaScript is "is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side" <a href="https://www.hackreactor.com/blog/what-is-javascript-used-for" target="_blank">[4]</a>, mainly used for website functionality. For example, if we want certain buttons to work or create image sliding show when each image is displayed one after each other, we have to write JavaScript functionality. This would be an example of front end website development. Where would we use JavaScript for the back end? We have not covered this with Code Nation yet but from my own experience with different programming languages like Java or C#, I could say that we have to create databases first, which we would connect with for example JavaScript CRUD functionality. CRUD means create, read, update and delete information on a website. Where else we can use JavaScript for the back end, is when we have to login into a website or fil in registering form online, shopping online because we have to make payments. All required data stays on a website but it is saved in databases that are protected by cybersecurity. 
        </p>

        <h3>Images, Videos, Audio, Document Files</h3>
        <p>
            "Multimedia comes in many different formats like images, music, sound, videos, records, films, animations." <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_media.asp" target="_blank">[5]</a>. If we want to display an image on our website, we should use a photograph file format of .jpeg, .jpg or.png. I  used .jpg. Other appropriate filetypes for websites videos are .mp4 or .ogg <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml5_video_all" target="_blank">[6]</a> and for audio .mp3 or.ogg <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml5_audio_all"target="_blank">[7]</a>, and for youtube videos, we could simply insert youtube link into our Html file where appropriate. I am interested in using .pdf filetype because "Portable Document Format" <a href="https://www.yourhtmlsource.com/starthere/fileformats.html" target="_blank">[2]</a> is convenient files are looking the same without any changes. I uploaded my certificates on my website, so I wanted this to be a copy of the original document without any changing of size or font. "Adobe Acrobat files were invented so that documents could be transferred between computers and indeed platforms, and still look the same" <a href="https://www.yourhtmlsource.com/starthere/fileformats.html" target="_blank">[2]</a>. On the other hand, many other people prefer using word document instead, then the .doc file should be used.
