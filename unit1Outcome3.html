    <div>
        <h2>3.1 Review the beneﬁts and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h2>
        <h3>VS Code and Visual Studio Comparison</h3>
        <p>
            We have already explored IT systems and tools but have not thought about productivity and efficiency. First, let's focus on the advantages and disadvantages of the tools I used so far. The main tool was the VS Code. I am already familiar with Visual Studio expanded version of VS Code and I could say, both do meet my requirements for creating a website. The advantage of the VS Code is that It is a cross-platform editor that could run on any operating system including macOS, Windows, Linux and Visual Studio it is even better because it has an integrated development environment. To be more productive we could use Visual Studio instead because we could have a choice of making a website or mobile application. There are more tools integrated into this environment. VS Code was enough to complete basic website design. I used Node++ before for the same purpose, to practice some Html, CSS and JavaScript code and it worked on the browser. So it does not matter what editor we are going to choose, more important if we can meet our requirements and achieve the goal.
        </p>

        <h3>Productivity</h3>
        <p>
            The goal is to work more productively and efficiently. There is a difference between those terms because productivity could be described as more work done in a short period and efficiently related to the quality of the work we are doing. Both are fundamental for meeting our target. Our deadline for the website project was short and to make the project productively, was a challenge. I think I could focus more on practical tasks rather than writing skills, in this way I would develop a better design website but we have to meet all the requirements and tasks that have to be done. To produce more work, we need more time, at least a few more days or more members of the team to support each other. We could then split the work into smaller tasks like maybe one person responsible for creating an amazing navigation bar, other for sorting flexboxes, another person could research good quality images for the web, etc. 
        </p>

        <h3>Efficiency</h3>
        <p>
            The more we would make, the better website would be, so productivity and efficiency work hand in hand together. If I ought to produce an amazing website, I have to prioritise my tasks like may spent less time on writing but more on design. How to keep a balance in between? Well, to able to do that we should use more software like JavaScript has many frameworks. But let's focus for a second on only front end design. I think we should use up to date technologies. For example, we use Html and CSS but we have not touched on html5 and css3. There are always more efficient ways of improving website responsiveness. I had an issue from the beginning to make my design responsive without using flexboxes but when implemented them, design improved. Html is not mobile-friendly where html5 it is mobile friendly. In Html, there is no video and audio support and in html5 there those features. Also, css3 loads quicker than CSS, so it means could improve the quality of the website. To complete the CSS file takes time because all design goes there, so if there were the possibility of dividing work into smaller tasks, would be easier to produce better designs. I had a limited amount of time and had to end the project with basic design. It won't stop me from coming back and improving design but it probably was easier to deliver the project with great design if we spent another extra day on it.

    <!----------------------------------- Div for 3.2 question ------------------------------------>
    <div>
        <h2>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h2>
        <h3>Productivity and Efficiency Meaning</h3>
        <p>
            How to be more productive and efficient. There are many ways but first, l would like to describe what productivity and efficiency mean. "Productivity and efficiency are two of the key goals of any business enterprise. But they are two very different things and often compete with each other. Improved productivity can come at the expense of efficiency and improved efficiency can reduce productivity. Put simply, productivity is the quantity of work produced by a team, business or individual. Efficiency, on the other hand, refers to the resources used to produce that work. So, the more effort, time or raw materials required to do the work, the less efficient the process. Efficiency can also refer to the quality of the output" <a href="https://setapp.com/lifestyle/productivity-vs-efficiency" target="_blank">[1]</a>. As I said before both work together, we could produce a lot of features on a website but half of them not functioning well, then efficiency is reduced and not meeting quality standards.
        </p>

        <h3>Ways To Improve Productivity and Efficiency, Planning</h3>
        <p>
            To produce more quality, we need to be organised and have a plan in hand. We have to be very specific and know exactly what are we going to create, have a vision of the website, predict how long each task would take. I used Gantt charts before, it is a visual calendar with set dates and time on Microsoft Project. I remember I printed it for my researching project and it worked because every time you have to check your calendar what are you going to do next, you spending time on it, it is easier if you have everything in one page graphically represented. For our website we used Trello boards, which are digital and easy to use, you can have access on your phone with all data.
        </p>

        <h3>Ways To Improve Productivity and Efficiency, Individual Learning Path</h3>
        <p>
            I think to advise others on how to improve their productivity and efficiency it is slightly difficult because everybody is different and has their ways of solving the problem. In my case, I am a visual learner, things have to be shown to me at least once, then I can go and do it. So in terms of planning, we have to measure how long we spent on certain tasks. For example, writing to me took longer than practical tasks just because I am enjoying designing things but to other people may writing is a very easy task and they finish quickly. To my logic writing I set as a task that took more time, let's say it was my challenge to complete it, so I started doing that first. Other people doing easier tasks first then moving to the difficult ones. I had to find my balance where to start. I had to be able to have multiple tasks at the same time. I started with writing tasks first, then moved to practical tasks, just because it was new materials, I had to jump into practice and leave writing. Then again come back to writing and carry on on practice. I would say I was following Agile methodology because I was able to constantly move from one cycle of work to another and in each increment to deliver some work. I was going back to previous tasks, improving them and again continue on the next tasks. Just to improve both productivity and efficiency, we have to find ways that are easier for us, set up individual tasks.

    <!----------------------------------- Div for 3.3 question ------------------------------------>
    <div>
        <h2>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h2>
        <p>
            If I had the same project from the beginning to the end again, I would use my time more efficiently. What I do mean, sometimes I spent too much time on certain tasks, I am trying to understand those tasks at my own pace. If I had the same project with the same knowledge as know, I would probably communicate more with tutors, I would share my progress a seek for advice rather than keep working on a project and asking very few questions if something is not very clear. For example, I struggled with changing the size of an image, tried to look online resources, applied many different options but still was not working, when I showed my issue to tutor, he spotted my error and then the problem was quickly fixed. I had to pay attention to all details in my Html code, I learnt a lesson that I have to pay more attention to details. Also in the future, I would use more software at the same time just to improve my coding skills, I would probably make the more complex website to challenge myself. I proved that I am capable of working on multiple tasks at the same time even sometimes it becomes overwhelming. I would also join the coding community for JavaScript, ask questions online, share my project there, share ideas with other people. I would learn to form others.

    <!----------------------------------- Div for 3.4 question ------------------------------------>
    <div>
        <h2>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h2>
        <h3>Testing Websites</h3>
        <p>Testing is a piece of work that has to be accomplished in the software development cycle. The software development life cycle is made of few sections: planning, analysis, design, implementation, testing and integration, maintenance. We have not used JavaScript on our website so we can not use testing tools like Selenium or FireUnit. We created a website with Html and CSS only, so we can test the performance of our website on different web browsers like Internet Explorer and Google Chrome or test our application on different operating systems like Windows and iOS. Sometimes design slightly different on each operating system. When we had a game group project, our first page of the game had some issues with design because a button that meant to appear in the middle of the page looked different on Windows and iOS. I had to change a design by changing style in CSS of button location. Testing is always working together with developing a website because everything we are making, we are testing. It is a good practice to do that because any bigger issues with code could be avoided if the code was tested regularly and more often. If we think in general about testing, it depends on an object-oriented programming language which testing tools to use. When I had my Java project of creating CRUD functionalities, I used Eclipse for my Java as environment and Eclipse normally have free testing tools implemented. I used JUnit to test my Java code. It was showing green lines if the test was successful and red - if failure.
        </p>

        <h3>Rules For Testing</h3>
        <p>
            Some rules apply to test if people are not sure where to begin. One of them is "functionality, usability, interface, compatibility, performance, security" <a href="https://tms-outsource.com/blog/posts/web-application-testing/" target="_blank">[1]</a>. I could say I checked functionality for Html and CSS, tested by running a program on the browser. If code was wrong and made changes won't happen. Usability should be tested by external people who can express their opinion if certain features have used and required for the website. The interface was examined many times, for example, image size or different text, checked immediately. To test compatibility is easy just to change screen size from full to partial, imagine it is a mobile device with a smaller screen and how your design would look. Performance there to check if all implemented functionalities are in order and responding by simply clicking on certain links or buttons. Security is the last but not least important because any application we make, we want to be secure to customers, all data should be protected, especially when users having transactions over the website.
