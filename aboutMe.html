            <h3>Code Nation Training</h3>
            <p>
                Welcome to my first blog website. I have to say thank you to the <a href="https://wearecodenation.com/" target="_blank">Code Nation</a> administration team, Ezra Christensen, who supported me in applying for an exciting <a href="developingCoding.pdf" target="_blank">3 weeks developing coding course</a>. I also would like to say a big thank you to the Code Nation training team, Liam Cookson and Jay Fannon, who encouraged me to participate in <a href="https://github.com/KristinaBrazinskaite/websiteportfolio" target="_blank">website development project GitHub code link</a>. I already had fun time in a group project of developing a Jungle Rumble game using JavaScript and HTML. <a href="https://github.com/KristinaBrazinskaite/gameportfolio   " target="_blank">Please click GitHub game code link </a> and <a href="https://kristinabrazinskaite.github.io/gameportfolio/" target="_blank">Github website link to play the game</a>. Please also look at <a href="https://trello.com/b/kU5kAXqt/kristina-website-development" target="_blank">Trello board for website</a> and <a href="https://trello.com/b/UZbOlmoK/jungle-rumble-game" target="_blank">Trello board for game project</a>.I joined Code Nation course due to few reasons; one - this company teaching HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which is required for Front End Development and second - Code Nation, have apprenticeships available, preparing employable future talents just like me, who is curious to learn and happy to join technical consultants. My dream would be to become a full-stack website developer. Code Nation is providing <a href="masterCoding.pdf" target="_blank">12 weeks master course</a> in Node.js, Vue.js, React, MongoDB, which would lead me to become a junior developer.

            <h3>QA Consulting Training</h3>
            <p>
                It is a great opportunity for me to start my career. I was always keen on learning programming languages. Just before Code Nation, I spent five weeks on Agile, Java, SQL, Networking and Security fulltime training in Manchester with <a href="https://www.qa.com/learners/become-a-digital-consultant/" target="_blank">QA Consulting</a>. While I was studying in the classroom, I also had access to CloudAcademy. I passed certificates in <a href="pythonCertificate.pdf" target="_blank">Python</a>, <a href="javaCertificate.pdf" target="_blank">Java</a>, <a href="cloudCertificate.pdf" target="_blank">Cloud</a> ,and <a href="devOpsCertificate.pdf" target="_blank">DevOps</a>. The main QA Consulting project required to follow Agile methodologies. I had to use Trello boards, which helped me to prioritise tasks. I started my project from drawing <a href="erd.pdf" target="_blank">Entity Relationship Diagram</a>, then transferred customer, orders, order item and items data into a local relational database, you can view <a href="sqlDiagram.PNG" target="_blank">MySQL Workbench SQL diagram</a>. Then I connected local database on Google Cloud MySQL Server. Once it was done, I had to retrieve all information from SQL tables by manipulating it with Java CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functionality. I had to test my application using JUnit (Java Unit Testing Framework). In the end, I had to upload <a href="https://github.com/Kbrazinskaite/ims/tree/master/src/main/java/com/qa" target="_blank">my Java code on GitHub</a> (Hosted Version Control System).

        <h3>BA (Hons) Interior Design Projects</h3>
        <p>
            I have more projects to share from my undergraduate studies. I spent three years studying Bachelors of Interior Design at <a href="https://aru.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/interior-design" target="_blank">Anglia Ruskin University</a> in Cambridge, graduated in 2017. During my studies, I have learnt conceptual development, space planning, site inspections, researching, communicating with construction management, tutors, and execution of the design. All my undergraduate projects were existing sites in Cambridge that I had to visit. My final undergraduate year project allowed me to investigate existing residential apartments of Radcliffe Court and convert it into <a href="https://kbrazinskaite3.wixsite.com/mysite" target="_blank">Bio Spiral, Cancer Research Medical Centre</a>. I also participated in <a href="https://kbrazinskaite3.wixsite.com/mysite" target="_blank">Jesus Green Lido outdoor swimming pool</a> project, modernised and redesigned exterior of the pool, included an outdoor coffee shop in my drawings. My retail project was the original Wedding Dress shop that I redesigned into <a href="https://kbrazinskaite3.wixsite.com/mysite" target="_blank">a Russian tea shop</a>. After graduation, I exhibited my Final Year Project at <a href="https://aru.ac.uk/arts-humanities-and-social-sciences/ruskin-gallery" target="_blank">Ruskin Gallery in Cambridge</a> and <a href="https://candidarts.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Candid Arts Trust Gallery in London</a>.

        <h3>C# Programming, Self Learning Projects</h3>
        <p>
            After I finished my bachelor's, I was questioning myself, if I want to continue this path. I had my aim to learn more about technologies because, during my undergraduate projects, I learnt three-dimensional modeling software such as AutoCAD, Revit, 3dsMax, continued learning Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator... I thought It is great that I am capable to draw with software and prepare renderings but something more I wanted to practice on. I was curious to learn how software is made. For this reason, I decided to learn programming on my own. I liked 3D Modelling and had an idea that one day I may develop my own game by learning C#. I bought some books for beginners, started watching YouTube, found Udemy tutorials and practiced some coding, started from creating variables, then learnt if statements, loops, arrays, classes. 
        </p>

        <h3>Commercial Work Experience</h3>
        <p>
            While I was focusing on my programming development, I gained four years of commercial experience in administration. I worked for security companies such as <a href="https://dardansecurity.co.uk/" target="_blank">Dardan</a>, <a href="https://www.mitie.com/about-mitie/" target="_blank">Mitie</a> and <a href="https://www.citysecurity.org.uk/" target="_blank">City Security</a>. I am proud of being trusted by my managers and being sent to international companies such as <a href="https://aru.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Anglia Ruskin University</a>, <a href="https://www.astrazeneca.co.uk/" target="_blank">AstraZeneca</a>, <a href="https://www.arm.com/" target="_blank">Arm</a>, <a href="https://www.amgen.com/" target="_blank">Amgen</a>, <a href="https://www.cropscience.bayer.com/" target="_blank">Bayer CropScience</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRC_Human_Nutrition_Research" target="_blank">MRC Elsie Widdowson Laboratory</a> (MRC website is no longer available because the building has been closed in 2018, so only Wikipedia website available), <a href="https://www.slcu.cam.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Sainsbury Laboratory</a>, <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/mids-east/" target="_blank">Victoria House NHS in Cambridge</a>, <a href="https://www.jomalone.co.uk/" target="_blank">Jo Malone, Estee Lauder Cosmetics in London</a>, <a href="https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/schools/peninsula-medical-school" target="_blank">Peninsula Medical School</a> and <a href="https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/schools/peninsula-medical-school" target="_blank">Peninsula Dental School</a> - University of Plymouth and Exeter. I built many transferable skills such as teamwork collaboration and communication. I was ambitious and committed to delivering exceptional customer servicing for customers and clients. Acted as the first face of global companies in handling multiple international phone calls and incoming inquiries, arranged business meetings, communicated with sales and marketing, financial and engineering departments.
