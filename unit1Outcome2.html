    <div>
        <h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h2>
        <h3>Visual Studio Code (VS Code)</h3>
        <p>
            The main tool for my website project was VS Code but before I could start using this software, I had to meet my laptop criteria because Code Nation training was virtual rather than classroom-based due to Coronavirus event. All I had to have, a laptop or computer in order with an updated operating system. My operating system is Windows even a laptop is mac iOS because I had Bootcamp installed where it is possible to split memory in Windows and iOS. I had enough memory to download the VS Code. The advantage of using this software that is free of charge. Before for programming, I used Visual Studio 2017, which let me use a trial for a month free so I could practice my coding skills. VS Code is used for many programming languages like Java, JavaScript, Go, Node.js and C++. For my website project, I had to use HTML and CSS only because my task was to develop a user interface only. I had to design a website with given tools. I was happy to use the VS Code because I could save many files in the same folder and run the program. I was introduced with CodePen but never had tried to code there but I was explained that all I needed to create an account and I could start my coding online. I think It is a great tool but because I have installed VS Code on my laptop first, I prefer and happy to use it instead.

        <h3>Trello Boards, Google Hangouts, Zoom and Slack</h3>
        <p>
            My communication tools were Trello boards, Google Hangouts, Zoom, and Slack. Trello was mainly for planning, organising and managing my projects, and Google Hangouts, Zoom, and Slack were more for communication with my tutors, training members. Every morning we used to start with a Slack, where we could create separate channels for a different purpose. For example, the "Coding" channel was for sending and sharing our JavaScript, HTML or CSS code, "Slides" channel was for accessing Code Nation presentations and any other taught materials. "General" channel for general messages to socialise with team members virtually and "Zoom Invites" channel for keeping all Zoom links.  It was very convenient to communicate with each other using Zoom, just disadvantage was that it used to switch off every 20 minutes or half an hour but for the last week Zoom was fixed and we had unlimited access all day of training from 10 am to 5.30 pm. Zoom was very similar to Google Hangouts because had a feature of sharing a desktop screen with other trainees. It was brilliant because it helped us to complete a group game project. We constantly collaborated through Google Hangouts, had a 15-minute standup meeting every morning before started working on the project. I was very happy with the virtual training program because all those communication tools were essential in our daily tasks, we had to talk to each other every day, ask questions, get support from tutors.

    <!----------------------------------- Div for 2.2 question ------------------------------------>
    <div>
        <h2>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h2>
        <p>
            I would agree that the VS Code and Trello were appropriate. Without a doubt, those tools were significant in making our projects. I can not imagine a project without planning. Trello was exactly for planning, I published as public so tutors had access to my boards as well. For the game project, we shared our project in a group and to the public. Trello is designed in a way that you can assign tasks to other people or yourself so it is clear who is doing what and where those tasks meet together, especially when we had group discussions, we could add everybody's name on Trello cards. As I mentioned earlier, Trello is a communication tool as well. My favourite communication tool probably was Google Hangouts and Zoom because I could interact with tutors, trainees. I like to see people face when someone is talking to me so it very engaging and also I can hear them. The best part was sharing screens because we could show visually what do we mean exactly, what issue is with the code. I supported my team members a lot on Google Hangouts. I could check their code errors, correct them and at the same time learn from other mistakes. I could share my ideas, how I would solve a problem. For example, we all had different ideas about how to write code. I suggested using while loops, while others continued with their if and else if statements in JavaScript. I think we all worked hard to meet the deadlines for our projects. Without communication that software was nothing. But now they are valuable and necessary for developing projects. I would use those tools in the future.

    <!----------------------------------- Div for 2.3 question ------------------------------------>
    <div>
        <h2>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your ﬁnal project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h2>
        <p>
            My website I would say has only one part - Front End, which means only user interface is designed and there is no Back End development included. In my opinion, a full product should be finished to meet professional employer standards but in terms of jobs, I do not have to apply for a full-stack development position yet. I would like to, but I guess I am not ready yet because I need further training. It could be a weakness but I am turning it to strength because I am willing to learn more and develop my programming skills. My strengths would be my designing skills because I completed my Bachelor of Interior Design where I have learnt designing tools such as Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign. I am including my Bachelor's portfolio link on my website. Regarding this website, my other strengths are that I am learning quickly and able to apply all taught materials into my project like creating a standard website with Html and CSS. I am happy with the outcome, just if we had more time I would apply more features like adding videos, animations, more moving objects into my project. I have already added an animated welcome message to my front page and it shows that I am doing research and trying new things even we were not taught. I do not think I would change the content of my website, I rather add more pages, add extra links or buttons, I would extend my navigation bar for extra projects. I am imagining to develop a commercial web page with CRUD functionality, add a login button where users could purchase an item. Also, I would like to improve my coding skills by trying different website frameworks like Angular, React, Vue. I would like my website to be more responsive, be available on mobile devices and computers. I would like to expand my knowledge as much as I can because I believe in professionalism, more I know, more professional I am and my goal is to reach the advanced programming level. This website is for my portfolio and new experience.

    <!----------------------------------- Div for 2.4 question ------------------------------------>
    <div>
        <h2>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h2>
        <p>
            If I had more time I would join other programming courses for website Back end development. The reason I am interested in this course because I aim to become a full-stack developer. I would like to meet my expectations of what my website portfolio should look like. I researched before that I can do Microsoft certificates for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Some companies preparing for the exam. If I want to save money, I would study on my own, I know the books that required and it would lead to preparation. It is important to me because I would like to prove that  I can memorise theory and complete practical tasks as well. Once I would be ready for the exam, I would book a place. This self-learning would impact my performance on making improvements to my project. Another choice would be to try and apply for apprenticeships with a portfolio I have and show the skills that I have so far. I already learnt some Java, Python, C# programming languages. It would boost my preparation for interviews. This particular website that I created so far is a great example of what I was able to do in a few days. Let's imagine what could I achieve if I spent more time practicing on back end development. To me, a website has to have functionalities. We can imagine if this website was published live, it had been hosted. Yes, it is another task that I would like to do, to host my website on a cloud Azure or AWS cloud hosting or Google. I would improve the design of my website to be more responsive with extra tools like JavaScript frameworks.

    <!----------------------------------- Div for 2.5 question ------------------------------------>
    <div>
        <h2>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are ﬁt for purpose</h2>
        <h3>Writing</h3>
        <p>
            The website development assignment is made of two parts - writing and development content. I had 21 questions to fully answer. I completed all the question answers, copied them to my Visual Studio Code into Html code, I created paragraph Html tags for this purpose. Each paragraph has its title, in this case, a question, and subtitles where appropriate. For example, many questions were expanded and were made of few parts. I named each card on my Trello Board as the name of each section of the assignment. The requirements for this website project were to answer to Unit 1 Outcome 1,2,3 and Unit 2 Outcome 1 questions about the website project, review my work. Each question had a matching label for example 1.1. Unit1. Outcome1. This was my naming convention for the first question, so I carried on to continue until I labeled every single card on my Trello board. I included more cards like researching.
        </p>

        <h3>Website Development</h3>
        <p>
            The second part of the assignment was to plan a website, design it and develop by coding with Html and CSS. I managed to complete each task on time. The development was split into few parts. The first was to transfer all text and images to Html, change the style in CSS, change colour, font size. The second part was to apply flexbox by creating classes for containers, add flex-direction, setting the width of each box, use flex-wrap so the website would be more responsive including a navigation bar. All we had to do to use all taught materials from Html, CSS and CSS flexbox presentations and implement it into our designed websites. We could add extra features if we wanted to. In the end, I had to update my Trello. I believe I met all criteria to compete with this challenge.
